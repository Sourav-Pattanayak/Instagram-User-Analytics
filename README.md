# Instagram-User-Analytics
In this project, I tackled various SQL tasks for Instagram. I found the five oldest users, identified inactive users, declared a contest winner, researched popular hashtags, and suggested the best day for ad campaigns. For investors, I calculated user engagement metrics and flagged potential bot accounts.
